# Anne-Lynn Design

A portfolio project. Uses Gatsby V2.

## Setup

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

    The Gatsby CLI helps you create new sites using Gatsby starters (like this one!)

    ```sh
    # install the Gatsby CLI globally
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  Enviornment Variables
    I've got two in a sample .env file which are used to plug directly into contentful.

## Branches

There are two main branches in this repo: `master` and `preview`. Both these branches contain the same content except that the preview branch is set up in `gatsby-config` to observe both the content that's published as well as the stuff that's in draft status.
