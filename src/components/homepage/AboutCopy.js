      <p>
        I am from the Ottawa River Valley and have been a designer since 2008. I
        have experience with in-house teams, agencies, and contracting roles for
        both print and packaging design. I also work as an independent
        contractor for all types of clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        I keep constant through research, and high-tempo production, and my
        works stands out especially because my interest and knowledge in the
        printing process, plus my need to maintain strong relationships with the
        printers which I work with. Not only can I build new concepts, but my
        experience in production art helps me move fast. I keep current by
        branching out: As this site shows, I also design for the modern web in
        an agile environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of design, I also enjoy gardening, floral design, as well as
        making things with my hands. And while I'm a long ways away from Regina,
        I will always be a Roughriders fan.
