  <Copy>
    <p>
      I am from the Ottawa River Valley and have been a designer since 2008. I
      have experience with in-house teams, agencies, and contracting roles for
      both print and packaging design. I also work as an independent contractor
      for all types of clients.
    </p>

    <p>
      I keep constant through research, and high-tempo production, and my works
      stands out especially because my interest and knowledge in the printing
      process, plus my need to maintain strong relationships with the printers
      which I work with. Not only can I build new concepts, but my experience in
      production art helps me move fast. I keep current by branching out: As
      this site shows, I also design for the modern web in an agile environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of design, I also enjoy gardening, floral design, as well as arts
      and crafts. And while I'm a long ways away from Regina, I will always be a
      Roughriders fan
